# Regression_Notebook
today we want to use regression models to predict the house prices of boston, the dataset came from here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd and the labels are the price for these houses
Here we try to find the best method that gives the best R squared, we tested some different sklearn regression models
